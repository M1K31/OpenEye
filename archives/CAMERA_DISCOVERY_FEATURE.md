## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend Flow:
```
User Request → Discovery Router → CameraDiscovery Service
                                          ↓
                                  OpenCV + Socket Testing
                                          ↓
                                  Auto-Configuration
                                          ↓
                                  Response with Cameras
```

### Frontend Flow:
```
User Click → API Request → Background Task (network only)
                                  ↓
                          Status Polling (every 2s)
                                  ↓
                          Update UI with Results
                                  ↓
                          Test → Quick Add → Database
```

### Network Scanning Algorithm:
1. Detect local subnets using `netifaces`
2. For each subnet, scan IP range (x.x.x.1-254)
3. For each IP, test ports: 554, 8554, 8080, 88
4. Generate RTSP URL patterns for responding IPs
5. Test each URL with OpenCV (5-second timeout)
6. Return validated cameras
