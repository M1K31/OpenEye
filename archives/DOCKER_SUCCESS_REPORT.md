## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. First-Run Setup
Since this is a fresh installation, you'll need to:

1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Complete the **First-Run Setup Wizard**
3. Create your admin account
4. Configure cameras (or use the mock camera)

### 2. Test Authentication
```bash
# Get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/token \
  -d "username=admin&password=your-password"

# Use token
TOKEN="your_token_here"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/faces/people
```

### 3. Test Face Management APIs
```bash
# List all people (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/faces/people

# Get face statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/faces/statistics

# Get recent detections
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/faces/detections
```

### 4. Test Camera Management
```bash
# List cameras
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/cameras

# Get mock camera stream
open http://localhost:8000/api/cameras/mock_cam_1/stream
```

```

### Container Status
```bash
# Check status
docker ps | grep openeye

# Health check
docker inspect openeye-surveillance | grep -A 10 Health

# Resource usage
docker stats openeye-surveillance
```

### Stop/Start
```bash

## 🐛 Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Deprecation Warnings
```
⚠️ pkg_resources deprecated - Will be removed in 2025-11-30
   Status: Non-critical, functionality works fine
   
⚠️ Pydantic 'orm_mode' renamed to 'from_attributes'
   Status: Non-critical, backward compatible
```

**Action**: These can be addressed in future updates but don't affect functionality.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs openeye-surveillance

# Rebuild fresh
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### If Port 8000 is Busy
```bash
# Find what's using port 8000
lsof -i :8000

# Change port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "8080:8000"  # Use 8080 instead
```

### If Database Issues
```bash
# Remove database and restart
rm ./data/openeye.db
docker restart openeye-surveillance
```

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Resource Usage
```
Memory: ~500MB (1 mock camera)
CPU: ~30-40% (during motion detection)
Disk: ~2GB (Docker image)
Startup: ~15 seconds
```

### Optimization Tips
1. Increase Docker memory to 4GB+ for multiple cameras
2. Use GPU acceleration for face recognition (optional)
3. Adjust worker count for load balancing
4. Configure resource limits in docker-compose.yml

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
2. ✅ Complete first-run setup wizard
3. ✅ Create admin account
4. ✅ Test the interface

### Configuration
1. ☐ Add real cameras (RTSP/USB)
2. ☐ Upload face images for recognition
3. ☐ Train face recognition model
4. ☐ Configure email/Telegram notifications
5. ☐ Set up smart home integrations

### Production Deployment
1. ☐ Generate proper SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY
2. ☐ Configure HTTPS/SSL with reverse proxy
3. ☐ Set up PostgreSQL for production database
4. ☐ Configure backups
5. ☐ Set up monitoring/alerting
