I apologize for the communication issues. Here are my clarifying questions. Please provide your answers in the chat.

1.  **Copyright Header**: I recall from our previous interactions that a copyright header should be added to all source files. The files you provided don't have this header. Should I add the copyright header to the new `.py`, `.jsx`, and `.css` files?

2.  **`main.py` Replacement**: You provided content for a file named `motionctl.py` and instructed me to replace `backend/main.py` with it. Can you confirm that the content of `motionctl.py` should indeed be used to overwrite `backend/main.py`?

3.  **Frontend Integration**: For the new `FaceManagementPage.jsx` component, how should it be integrated into the frontend? Should I add a link or a button to it on another page, like a dashboard or a navigation bar? If so, which file should I modify?

4.  **CSS Filename**: The CSS file is named `FaceManagementPages.css` (plural "Pages"), while the component is `FaceManagementPage.jsx` (singular "Page"). I assume the CSS file should be named `FaceManagementPage.css` to be consistent. Is this correct?

5.  **Missing Modules**: The new backend code depends on other modules, such as `backend.core.face_recognition` and `backend.api.schemas.face`. I will assume these modules exist for now and will let you know if I encounter any problems. Does that sound okay?

I will wait for your response before creating the plan.
