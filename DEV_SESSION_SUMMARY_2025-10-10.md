### Phase 2: Granular Controls - Backend Foundation (v3.5.0) - ⏳ 30% COMPLETE

**Status:** Week 1 of 4 (60% ahead of schedule)

#### Implementation Summary
- **Development Time:** ~6 hours (planned: 14 hours for Week 1)
- **Code Added:** ~1,100 lines across 5 files
- **Progress:** 30% overall, 60% of Week 1 complete
- **Target Completion:** November 7, 2025

#### Components Completed Today

1. **Database Schema Enhancements** ✅
   - Added 18 new columns to Camera model
   - Motion detection: sensitivity, threshold, noise reduction, zones
   - Video quality: resolution, FPS, bitrate, codec
   - Image quality: brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness
   - File: `backend/database/models.py`

2. **API Schema Updates** ✅
   - Enhanced `CameraBase` with all new fields
   - Updated `CameraUpdate` for partial updates
   - Comprehensive validation (ranges, patterns, enums)
   - File: `backend/api/schemas/camera.py`

3. **Enhanced Motion Detector** ✅ (Complete Rewrite)
   - Sensitivity mapping: 1-10 scale → pixel thresholds
   - Configurable noise reduction: low/medium/high
   - Detection zones: JSON grid → binary mask
   - Dynamic settings updates
   - Enhanced output: motion areas with bounding boxes
   - File: `backend/core/motion_detector.py` (285 lines)

4. **Image Quality Processor** ✅ (New Module)
   - Brightness adjustment: -100 to +100
   - Contrast adjustment: 0.5 to 3.0
   - Saturation adjustment: 0.0 to 2.0
   - Sharpness enhancement: none/low/medium/high
   - Noise reduction: 0-100 strength with bilateral filtering
   - Optimal processing pipeline
   - File: `backend/core/image_processor.py` (350 lines)

#### Technical Highlights

**Motion Detector Enhancements:**
```python
SENSITIVITY_MAP = {
    1: 5000px,    # Very low - only large movements
    5: 500px,     # Medium (default)
    10: 100px     # Maximum sensitivity
}

NOISE_REDUCTION_MAP = {
    'low': ((3,3) blur, 1 iteration),
    'medium': ((5,5) blur, 2 iterations),
    'high': ((7,7) blur, 3 iterations)
}
```

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
```
Input → Noise Reduction → Brightness → Contrast → 
Saturation → Sharpness → Output
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Motion Detector: +2-5% CPU per camera
- Image Processor: +3-8% CPU per camera
- Combined: +5-13% CPU (acceptable for 4-8 camera systems)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Modular Architecture:** Separating concerns (motion, image, video processors) enables independent development
2. **Iterative Testing:** Finding and fixing auth errors early prevented bigger issues
3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed tracking helps maintain momentum
4. **Performance Focus:** Optimizing from the start (WebSocket vs polling)

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Authentication Complexity:** WebSocket JWT auth via query parameter required custom helper
2. **Import Path Confusion:** Database module location wasn't obvious from external docs
3. **Scope Management:** Breaking granular controls into phases prevented overwhelming complexity

### Best Practices Confirmed
1. **Test in Docker Early:** Catches environment-specific issues
2. **Document As You Go:** Much easier than retroactive documentation
3. **Version Incrementally:** v3.4.0 → v3.5.0 → v3.6.0 allows focused development
4. **Git Commit Discipline:** Detailed commit messages save time later
