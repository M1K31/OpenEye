## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

#### 1. Face Recognition Photo Upload (FIXED)
**Issue:** File upload button was completely invisible in the face management modal  
**Root Cause:** Button used undefined CSS variable `var(--primary-color)`  
**Impact:** Users couldn't upload photos for face recognition training  
**Fix:** Replaced with hardcoded blue color (#007bff) with enhanced styling
- Added file icon emoji üìÅ
- Bold, larger font
- Hover effects
- Explicit inline styles

**Verification:**
```bash
# Photos now upload successfully
docker exec openeye-v3.3.7 ls -lh /app/faces/asdf/
total 3.3M
-rw-r--r-- 1 openeye openeye 917K Oct 10 03:08 IMG_0181.jpeg
-rw-r--r-- 1 openeye openeye 1.2M Oct 10 03:08 IMG_0228.jpeg
-rw-r--r-- 1 openeye openeye 1.2M Oct 10 03:08 IMG_0234.jpeg

# Model trains successfully
-rw-r--r-- 1 openeye openeye 3.3K Oct 10 03:09 /app/face_encodings.pkl
```

#### 2. Camera Discovery 404 Errors (FIXED)
**Issue:** `/api/cameras/discover/status` returned 404 Not Found  
**Root Cause:** Router registration order - cameras router intercepted discovery routes  
**Impact:** Console spam, camera discovery status polling failed  
**Fix:** Moved discovery router registration BEFORE cameras router in `main.py`

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/cameras/discover/status
{"scanning":false,"cameras_found":0,"cameras":[]}  # ‚úÖ Works!
```

### Minor Fixes

#### 3. Alert Configuration Data Validation
**Issue:** 422 errors when saving alert config with empty email fields  
**Root Cause:** Frontend sending empty strings `""` instead of `null`  
**Fix:** Clean empty strings to `null` before API submission

#### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Issue:** Inline SVG images blocked by restrictive CSP  
**Fix:** Updated CSP to allow `data:` URIs for images
```
default-src 'self';
img-src 'self' data:;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
script-src 'self'
```

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Frontend Enhancements
- **Axios Interceptor:** Reads JWT token from localStorage on every request
- **Enhanced Logging:** Detailed console logs for debugging upload and modal issues
- **Modal Styling:** Explicit inline styles to prevent CSS conflicts
- **File Input UX:** Hidden native file input, custom styled label button

### Backend Enhancements
- **Router Order:** Discovery routes registered before parameterized camera routes
- **Middleware:** Updated CSP headers for better compatibility
