## ✅ Success Indicators

When the build completes successfully, you should see:

```
[+] Building XX.Xs (27/27) FINISHED
 => => exporting to image
 => => naming to docker.io/library/openeye-surveillance_openeye
```

---

## 🔧 If Build Fails

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Insufficient Memory**
```bash
# Check Docker memory allocation
docker info | grep -i memory

# Solution: Increase Docker Desktop memory to 4GB+
# Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory
```

**2. Build Timeout**
```bash
# Restart build
docker compose build --no-cache
```

**3. Network Issues**
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping pypi.org

# Use different mirror
pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
```

**4. dlib Compilation Fails**
```bash
# This is the most common issue
# Requires: cmake, gcc, g++
# Solution: Dockerfile already includes these
```

## 📈 Build Progress Tracking

### Current Installation (as of last check):

```
✅ pip upgraded (25.2)
✅ setuptools upgraded (80.9.0)
✅ wheel installed
🔄 Installing fastapi...
⏳ Installing opencv-contrib-python... (will take longest)
⏳ Installing dlib... (requires compilation)
⏳ Installing face_recognition...
⏳ Installing remaining 40+ packages...
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Build

### 1. Verify Build Success
```bash
# Check if image was created
docker images | grep openeye

# Expected output:
# openeye-surveillance_openeye  latest  abc123def456  2 minutes ago  800MB
```

### 2. Run the Container
```bash
# Using docker-compose (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# Or using docker run
docker run -d \
  --name openeye-test \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  openeye-surveillance_openeye:latest
```

### 3. Check Container Status
```bash
# View running containers
docker ps

# Check logs
docker logs -f openeye-surveillance

# Check health status
docker inspect openeye-surveillance | grep -A 10 Health
```

### 4. Test the Application
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy","service":"openeye"}

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

## 📊 Live Monitoring Dashboard

Run this command in a separate terminal for live updates:

```bash
# Live build log
watch -n 2 'tail -30 /Volumes/Storage/Dev/GitHubProjects/OpenEye-OpenCV_Home_Security/opencv-surveillance/docker-build.log'

# Or simpler:
tail -f docker-build.log | grep -E "Building|FINISHED|ERROR|Step|Running"
```

---

## 🚨 Stop Build If Needed

```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep "docker compose build"

# Kill the process
kill 9224

# Or force stop Docker build
docker compose build --no-cache  # Will fail and stop current build
pkill -f "docker compose build"
```

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **First build is slowest** - Subsequent builds will be much faster due to Docker layer caching
2. **Be patient with dlib** - It needs to compile from source (~5 minutes)
3. **Monitor RAM usage** - Build requires at least 2GB available
4. **Don't interrupt** - Let it complete for best results
5. **Check logs regularly** - `tail -f docker-build.log`
